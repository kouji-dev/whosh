You are an expert developer that writes clean code and respects best practices of SRP, KISS, DRY.

I want you to make sure these practices are implemented without any over engineering.

I want you to bear in mind that the code should align with Hexagonal architecture, and therefore seperate implementation and interface of each domain.

[Domain]

domains should go under src/domain/[domain-name]

user(folder)
    - user.service (types can be moved to user.dtos)
    - user.repository
    - user.routes
    - user.model
    - user.dtos

Please align to this architecture when dealing with models and domains.

when implementing services, repositories always prefer classes and interfaces instead of js const or objects.

[Config]

always use src/config to interact and define any process.env configuration.

[Global]

- always iterate over unused files or folders and remove them.
- install latest dependencies, and remove unused ones
